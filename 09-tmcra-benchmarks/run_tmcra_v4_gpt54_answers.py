EVIDENCE_OPERATION_ANSWER_PROMPT = f"""You answer one memory question from a compiled, immutable evidence packet.
Return exactly one JSON object and no prose using this schema:
{{"schema_version":"{ANSWER_SCHEMA}","answerability":"sufficient|insufficient","claims":[{{"claim_id":"C01","text":"one factual claim","origin":"memory_fact|memory_inference|memory_derived|query_context|model_knowledge","support_ids":["E01"],"computation_ids":["O01"]}}],"missing_requirements":["R01"],"answer":"short complete answer"}}

Read task_intent.output_origin before answering. task_intent and planner_source_groups are routing hints, not truth or answerability decisions. requirement_catalog lists the response requirement IDs but deliberately carries no planner missing/satisfied judgment. Determine support or absence yourself from the complete Source reservoir. user_memory_cues is a deterministic navigation index of slow-memory claims and user-authored Source or source-group context; it is not separate proof, so inspect the referenced Source before binding a remembered claim. For memory_conditioned_generation, first recover the user's grounded preferences or constraints and then generate the requested recommendation or advice; a ready-made historical answer is not required. Carry forward relevant prior choices, owned tools, resources, genres, constraints, and already-adopted solutions instead of defaulting to generic advice. When several relevant cues differ in specificity, preserve the narrower grounded detail rather than replacing it with a broad category. The final answer itself must explicitly show how at least one specific remembered constraint shaped the response; do not leave personalization only inside the claims array. Do not declare the task insufficient merely because the exact requested recommendation was not historical when grounded memory can personalize a new answer and model knowledge can fulfill the current target. Query context never requires Source evidence IDs. Model knowledge does not require Source evidence IDs when it is allowed for memory-conditioned generation. External-tool premises remain unresolved until a tool result exists.
Source evidence is ordered by frozen retrieval priority and then by source order within each selected session; source_order is not an event date. Each Source item carries its immutable historical_date and timestamp when available. Resolve words such as today and yesterday against that Source item's timestamp, never against the question date. Inspect source_group_context as neighboring source context and use each neighbor's own timestamp. Before answering, internally build an exact evidence ledger for the requested entity: list every matching event or item, its event date or stated relative time, state (actual, planned, hypothetical, or mentioned), and Source ID. Deduplicate repeated mentions of the same event or item before counting. For latest/earliest/order/duration questions, compare event times grounded in Source text plus its timestamp, not source_order or database session_index. If a when, before, or after clause names another remembered event, treat that event as a candidate temporal endpoint and compare both Source dates before using the question date. Use the question date only when the wording actually asks for distance from the query time.
Each Source item may include memory_contexts and attachments. A slow_context is the slow graph's durable interpretation and must retain its capsule, claim, and provenance identity. A fast_context is an atomic current-memory interpretation. An attachment marked override with precedence=newer_fast_evidence has controller-verified precedence over a conflicting slow claim in the same canonical slot. These graph views organize meaning but do not replace Source proof: support final remembered claims with the Source evidence ID carrying the context, and inspect its immutable text before relying on it.
Use only supplied Source evidence IDs and verified computation IDs. memory_fact claims require direct support_ids. memory_inference claims require support_ids for every Source premise and represent source-grounded comparison or synthesis that has no verified operation result. memory_derived claims require computation_ids. query_context claims may have empty binding lists in every task when they state only information supplied by the current question, such as the question date or arithmetic derived solely from it. Only memory_conditioned_generation may use model_knowledge claims with empty binding lists; label their origin explicitly, and include at least one memory_fact, memory_inference, or memory_derived claim showing how remembered constraints shaped the answer. Never label remembered information as query_context or model_knowledge. planner_operation_candidates expose no result because their operand selection has not been semantically certified; independently inspect their Source supports. lexical_anchor_ids are deterministic search hints, not proof. Never transfer values between different entities, people, places, events, or activities. Preserve requested temporal order, distinct values, totals, and update precedence.
For preferences, use the specific historical experiences in Source evidence. Treat named entities and activities exactly: a shorter, broader, or related term is not the requested multiword entity unless the source explicitly says they are equivalent. For false premises or entity mismatch, explicitly state that the requested target is not established, then optionally state related counterevidence. For count/list questions, enumerate distinct matching items before producing the total. For changing facts, apply latest update precedence using event time and source-group context. A sufficient answer must cover every requirement and have no missing_requirements. An insufficient answer must name supplied requirement IDs that remain unresolved after inspecting all Source evidence. Never use hidden supervision or outside facts for remembered claims."""


SEMANTIC_EVIDENCE_ANSWER_PROMPT = f"""Execute one verified memory task contract.
Return exactly one JSON object and no prose using this schema:
{{"schema_version":"{SEMANTIC_ANSWER_SCHEMA}","response_status":"answered|partial|answered_with_context|requires_tool|clarification|not_answerable","claims":[{{"claim_id":"C01","text":"one final claim","origin":"memory_fact|memory_derived|model_knowledge|tool_result","premise_ids":["P01"],"source_claim_ids":["M01"],"computation_ids":["O01"]}}],"unresolved_premise_ids":[],"answer":"concise complete response"}}

The task contract defines the requested target and output shape. The answerability certificate is authoritative; do not redo retrieval, invent missing memory, or change its answer policy.
For memory_fact claims, use only Source claim IDs bound to the cited premises. For memory_derived claims, use only completed computation IDs bound to the cited premises. Preserve entity, time, polarity, modality, cardinality, ordering, and update state.
When the policy is answer_with_memory_context, treat remembered claims as constraints or background. You may produce model_knowledge claims needed to fulfill the current request, but never describe them as remembered facts and never attach Source claim IDs to them.
When the policy is answer_partial, answer only the supported portion, explicitly state the unresolved limitation, use response_status partial, and preserve the certificate's unresolved premise IDs. For a memory-conditioned task, the partial answer must explicitly use at least one bound memory claim rather than falling back to a generic response. Never turn a partial count or other incomplete derived aggregate into a final total.
When the policy is call_tool, clarify, or abstain, use the matching response_status and explain the unresolved need without fabricating an answer. unresolved_premise_ids must exactly match the certificate.
Do not cite raw evidence IDs directly. Do not use benchmark labels or hidden supervision."""
